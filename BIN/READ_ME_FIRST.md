# OPERATION ETERNAL LIBERATION

A community kit for playing online via RPCS3 and an RPCN server.

## Quick start

On Windows, open the desktop shortcut **Play OPERATION ETERNAL LIBERATION**.

On Linux, run this from the install folder:

```
./Play\ OPERATION\ ETERNAL\ LIBERATION\ \(Linux\).sh
```

The first Linux run asks for your password once: the game server listens on
ports 80 and 443, and Linux requires a one-time permission for that. It is
granted to the kit's own bundled interpreter only.

You provide:

1. PS3 firmware. When RPCS3 prompts, point it at your `PS3UPDAT.PUP`.
2. The game at version 2.11. In RPCS3, *File > Install Packages/Raps*, then install your game files.
3. The 15 TSS files. Drop them into the `TSS` folder next to this file.

Always launch the game from the launcher, not directly from RPCS3, so the network config matches your current LAN IP.

## Server settings

The **Play** tab has two server groups. They are independent and any combination works.

**RPCN Server** controls login and matchmaking:

- *Official*: the community RPCN at np.rpcs3.net.
- *Self-Hosted*: runs an RPCN server on your machine.
- *Custom*: any other RPCN server (enter its host).

**Game Server** controls the backend that answers the game's HTTP calls:

- *Self-Hosted*: runs on your machine. Works both for singleplayer and multiplayer (the multiplayer matchmaking and netcode is handled by RPCN).
- *Remote*: a game server hosted elsewhere. Enter the address as `host:http_port:https_port`, for example `<host_ip>:8000:8001`.

## Saves

The **Saves** tab has three things:

- A save editor for credits, fuel, tickets, and other fields.
- A backup browser. RPCS3 writes a local copy of every cloud save, so you can roll back any time.
- A "new game" override that makes the game offer a fresh start without deleting your cloud data.

## Updates

On Windows, run the newer installer over the existing install. On Linux,
extract the newer tarball over the existing folder. Either way your RPCS3
portable data, launcher settings, and `TSS` folder are preserved.

## Troubleshooting

- **"Failed to connect to Playstation Network".** Click the RPCN icon in RPCS3 to confirm you are logged in. Check that all 15 TSS files show as present on the **TSS Files** tab.
- **"Failed to connect to game server".** If self-hosted, the game server console window should be open. If remote, check the address and that the server is reachable.
- **RPCN login fails (self-hosted).** Make sure the rpcn process is running and your firewall allows TCP 31313 and 31315.
- **Can't host or join rooms.** In RPCS3, right-click the game, open *Custom Configuration > Network*, enable **UPnP**.
- **"Game server ports" error (Linux).** Run the command shown in the dialog, or run this once from the install folder:

  ```
  sudo setcap cap_net_bind_service=+ep _app/python/bin/python3-gameserver
  ```

- **Qt platform plugin error (Linux).** Desktop distros ship the needed X11 client libraries; minimal ones may not:

  ```
  Debian/Ubuntu:  sudo apt install libxcb-cursor0 libxkbcommon-x11-0
  Fedora:         sudo dnf install xcb-util-cursor libxkbcommon-x11
  Arch:           sudo pacman -S xcb-util-cursor libxkbcommon-x11
  ```

- **Where the logs are (Linux).** RPCS3: `~/.cache/rpcs3/RPCS3.log`. Game server: `_app/gameserver/gameserver.log`.

## Hosting your own server

The kit ships with a Docker setup that runs the game server and RPCN together on a Linux machine. See the Hosting section of the project README on GitHub:
