# Licensing

This repository contains original code authored by The -OPERATIONS- Team alongside patches and build glue that interact with upstream projects under their own licenses. The table below maps each subtree to its governing license.

## RPCS3 compatibility exception

The original code in this repository is licensed AGPL-3.0-or-later, with an additional permission (granted under AGPL-3.0 section 7) allowing it to be combined with RPCS3 and conveyed under GPL-2.0. The full text of that permission is in [LICENSE](LICENSE).

This permission exists because RPCS3 is licensed GPL-2.0-only, which is not directly combinable with AGPL-3.0. The exception applies only to combinations involving RPCS3; the standalone program remains AGPL-3.0-or-later.

## Distributed binary bundles

The Windows installer produced by `package.bat` bundles:

- The launcher and game server (AGPL-3.0-or-later, with the RPCS3 exception).
- RPCS3 (GPL-2.0-only) and our patches to it (GPL-2.0-only).
- RPCN (AGPL-3.0-or-later) and our patches to it (AGPL-3.0-or-later).
- An embeddable CPython 3.12 runtime (PSF License) and PySide6 (LGPL-3.0) installed at first run.

Each component remains under its original license inside the bundle. Mere aggregation in the same installer does not relicense any of them.
