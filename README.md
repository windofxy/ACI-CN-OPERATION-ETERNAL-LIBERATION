# OPERATION ETERNAL LIBERATION

A community kit for playing OPERATION ETERNAL LIBERATION online via [RPCS3](https://rpcs3.net) and a community [RPCN](https://github.com/RipleyTom/rpcn) server.

## Playing

### Windows

Run the latest `OP-ETERNAL-Setup-*.exe` from the releases page. It installs the kit and creates a desktop shortcut. Open the shortcut.

### Linux

Download the latest `OP-ETERNAL-*-linux-x86_64.tar.xz` from the releases page, extract it anywhere, and run the play script:

```
tar -xJf OP-ETERNAL-*-linux-x86_64.tar.xz
cd OPERATION-ETERNAL-LIBERATION
"./Play OPERATION ETERNAL LIBERATION (Linux).sh"
```

The game server uses ports 80 and 443, so on first launch you are asked for your password to allow that.

### Both platforms

You provide:

1. PS3 firmware. When RPCS3 prompts, point it at your own `PS3UPDAT.PUP`.
2. The game at version 2.11. In RPCS3, *File > Install Packages/Raps*; install your game files.
3. The 15 TSS files. Drop them into the `TSS` folder.

Always launch the game from the launcher, not directly from RPCS3. The launcher applies the right game patches and emulator settings before starting RPCS3, and keeps the network config in sync with your current LAN IP in order to make sure that game network packet routing is correct.

The **Saves** tab includes a save editor, a save backup browser, and a "new game" override. RPCS3 writes a local copy of every cloud save, so you can roll back or restart even after the cloud copy has been overwritten.

### Updating

On Windows, run a newer installer over the existing install. On Linux, extract a newer tarball over the existing folder. Your RPCS3 portable data, RPCN config files, launcher settings, and `TSS` folder are preserved.

### Troubleshooting

- **"Failed to connect to Playstation Network".** Click the RPCN icon in RPCS3 to confirm you're logged in, and check that all 15 TSS files show as present in the launcher's **TSS Files** tab.
- **"Failed to connect to game server".** Make sure the mock game server is listening on the same IP as your LAN, or, if it's hosted remotely, that the remote address is reachable.
- **RPCN login fails (self-hosted).** Make sure the rpcn process is running and your firewall allows TCP 31313 and 31315.
- **Can't host or join rooms.** Right-click the game in RPCS3, open *Custom Configuration > Network*, enable **UPnP**.
- **TSS warning on launch.** Drop your 15 TSS files into the `TSS` folder.
- **"Game server ports" error (Linux).** Run the command shown in the dialog once, then launch again.

## Hosting your own server

`BIN/docker-compose.yml` runs the game server and RPCN together on a Linux machine. A small VPS works fine.

You need:

- A Linux box with Docker installed.
- The full project source, cloned with `git clone`.

### Build the images

From the `BIN` directory:

```
docker compose build
docker save oel-gameserver:latest oel-rpcn:latest | gzip > oel-images.tar.gz
```

If your build host's CPU architecture differs from your server's, prefix the build with `DOCKER_DEFAULT_PLATFORM=linux/amd64`.

### Copy to the server

```
scp oel-images.tar.gz docker-compose.yml user@your-vps:~/
```

### Load and start

```
mkdir -p ~/oel/_app/rpcn && cd ~/oel
mv ~/docker-compose.yml .
docker load < ~/oel-images.tar.gz
docker compose up -d
```

### Open the ports

Allow these on your VPS firewall, plus any cloud-provider firewall in front of it:

- `8000` TCP (game server HTTP)
- `8001` TCP (game server HTTPS)
- `31313` TCP (RPCN login and matchmaking)
- `31315` TCP (RPCN TSS HTTP)
- `3657` UDP (RPCN signaling)

### Add TSS files

After first start, the RPCN container creates a `tss_data/<comm_id>/` subdirectory. Copy your 15 TSS files there, then:

```
docker compose restart rpcn
```

### Connect from the launcher

On the **Play** tab:

- **RPCN Server**: pick **Custom** and enter your server's host.
- **Game Server**: pick **Remote** and enter `<host_ip>:8000:8001`.

### Logs

The game server writes its log file and rotated archives to `~/oel/logs/gameserver/` on the host. For RPCN, use `docker compose logs rpcn`.

### Updating the server

Rebuild locally, ship a new tarball, then on the server:

```
docker load < ~/oel-images.tar.gz
docker compose up -d
```

The bind-mounted `_app/rpcn/` data is preserved across updates.
