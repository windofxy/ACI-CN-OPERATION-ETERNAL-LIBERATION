# Stamp the build version into OEL.iss and BIN/_app/launcher.py.
#
# Logic:
#   - On a tag push (GITHUB_REF=refs/tags/X.Y.Z[.W]), the tag IS the version.
#     The tag is checked against the AppVersion already baked into OEL.iss
#     so a forgotten bump fails CI loudly instead of producing a mislabeled
#     installer.
#   - On a main-branch build the version is "<AppVersion>-<short-sha>".
#   - On any other branch it is "<AppVersion>-<branch>-<short-sha>" so
#     parallel branches don't produce indistinguishable artifact names.
#
# Re-runnable: the AppVersion / VERSION regexes are anchored on unique
# line prefixes, so running this twice on the same tree is a no-op the
# second time.
#
# Sets VERSION in GITHUB_ENV when running under GitHub Actions, so later
# workflow steps can reference it (release notes, artifact names, etc.).
#
# Designed for both Linux runners and Git Bash on Windows runners. Both
# ship GNU sed, which is what the `sed -i.bak` invocation expects.

Bump the AppVersion (and re-commit) before pushing the release tag.
